# Tip Calculator

This simple tool was developed to streamline tip calculations at my workplace, saving valuable time. While it's tailored to my specific job role, you can easily customize it to suit your needs. The calculator takes into account hours worked, deducts sales tax, and provides the final tip amount for employees.
How It Works

    Input Hours Worked: Enter the number of hours each employee worked.
    Deduct Sales Tax: The calculator automatically subtracts the applicable sales tax from the total.
    Calculate Tips: Based on the adjusted total and hours worked, it computes the tips for each employee.
    Output: The final tip amount for each employee is displayed.

Feel free to adapt the code to fit your specific requirements and make tip calculations a breeze!
